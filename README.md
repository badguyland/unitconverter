It's possible to convert length, volumetric, time and weight units.

## Background

A dictionary for unit conversions is AI generated. It seems to be correct, only does not contain a comprehensive set of units. 


## Notes

It is advised to use PySimpleGUI 4.60.5 as Version 5.0.0, needs user registration or payment.
 

## Future work

- Additional conversion units
- Non-standard GUI skin
